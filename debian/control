Description: serial console management program
 ConMan is a serial console management program designed to support a large
 number of console devices and simultaneous users.
 It supports:
     - local serial devices
     - remote terminal servers (via the telnet protocol)
     - IPMI Serial-Over-LAN (via FreeIPMI)
     - Unix domain sockets
     - external processes (e.g., using Expect for telnet / ssh / ipmi-sol
             connections)
 Its features include:
     - logging (and optionally timestamping) console device output to file
     - connecting to consoles in monitor (R/O) or interactive (R/W) mode
     - allowing clients to share or steal console write privileges
     - broadcasting client output to multiple consoles
